# Social VS. Societal

**Social** and **Societal** are both common words in the field of social psychology, sometimes we can even see these two words juxtaposed in a sentence and contrasted with each other, just like this:
> structural crime correlates, which include geographical, **societal**, cultural, **social**, and community differences. (Lowry, et al., 2016)

So what are the differences between them? 
Firstly, let's check out the definitions of these two words in _The Advanced Oxford English-Chinese Dictionary, 9th_.
* Social
  1. adj. connected with society and the way it is organized 社会的
  2. adj. connected with your position in society 社会上的，社会地位的
  3. adj. connected with activities in which people meet each other for pleasure 社交的，交际的，联谊的
  4. adj. living naturally in groups, rather than alone 群居的
  5. adj. = sociable 友好的

* Societal  
  1. adj. connected with society and the way it is organized 社会的，关于社会的

There seems to be no essential difference between these two concept, except that **societal**  may be more pedantic than **social** and is mainly used in academic fields. 

But that's not exactly the case. By searching the Internet, I find that there are some subtle differences between these concepts. 

Generally speaking, **Social** refers to the activities and corresponding characteristics parallel with culture, politics, economy, _etc._ at the **individual level**. That is, it relates to a divison within a horizontal level. **Sociteal** refers to a kind of influence source parallel with intrapersonal and interpersonal. That is, it is subordiante to a hierachical division.
